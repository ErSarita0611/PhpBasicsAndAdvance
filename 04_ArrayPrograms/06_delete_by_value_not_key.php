//array_search() method:

/* The value is first looked for in the array and then deleted successively. 
The array_search() method is used to search the array for a specified value.
 If it is successful, it returns the first corresponding key. The array_search() 
 method is case-sensitive in terms of matching the specified value with the iterated 
 values of the array. If there are multiple occurrences of the same value, only 
 one is fetched out of it. */
